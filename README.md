# Renti Take-Home Project: Book Club Management System

## Project Overview

Develop a Book Club Management System where users can join book clubs, participate in discussions, and manage their reading lists. This project will showcase your ability to build a full-stack web application, handle user interactions, and implement collaborative features.

This is intentionally designed as an open ended project. There is a lot of room to show your own creativity and ideas.

We do not expect your submission to be a complete solution. Limit the time you spend on the project and implement as much as you feel is appropriate. Some ideas for features that you could include are listed below.

Some initial data sets are provided for you to use.

### Features

- User Authentication: Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.
- Profile Management: Users should be able to update their profile information and manage their reading preferences.
- Book Club Management: Users should be able to create, join, and leave book clubs.
- Book List: Users can add books to their reading list and mark them as read, currently reading, or want to read.
- Discussion Forums: Each book club should have a discussion forum where members can create and reply to threads about books.
- Book Search: Users should be able to search for books by title, author, or genre.
- Recommendations: Implement a feature to recommend books to users based on their reading history and preferences.

### Technology Stack

- Back-End: Use any of the following (Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.)
- Front-End: Use any of the following (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.)
- Database: Use any of the following (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

### Deliverables

- Codebase: A GitHub repository with the complete source code.
- README: A README file explaining how to set up, run, and test the application.
- API Documentation: API documentation detailing the endpoints and their usage.

## Evaluation Criteria

- We expect you to write the code based on what you have on your CV. If you say you are a senior developer we expect the code to be the most state of art as possible.
- Your ability to explain your decisions will be one of the major evaluation points
- Functionality: What features have you implemented? How have you solved the problems associated with that feature?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
- Best Practices: Are best practices followed for security, error handling, and performance?
- Testing: Are there unit and integration tests to ensure the functionality works as expected?
- Documentation: Is the setup and usage of the application well-documented?

## Bonus Points

- Deployment: Deploy the application on a platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS) and provide the live URL.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
- Advanced Features: Implement additional features like notifications for new discussions, book club events, or integration with external book APIs (e.g., Google Books API).
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines.
